## Notes

### Tech Stack

The following pieces of technology were included in the job ad:

- Next.js
- Prisma
- Tailwind.css
- Framer motion

Here's a new one that I added:

- trpc
  - uses rpc instead of REST
  - end-to-end typesafety
  - thin wrapper around React Query on the client side
  - good integration with prisma
  - extensive documentation
